# godot-vehicle

WIP implementation of a 3D Raycast Vehicle, customizable alternative to Godot's VehicleBody3D node.

**Grip Forgiveness** gives the "Arcade" feel (1 = more arcadey, grip not limited by acceleration or braking).<br>
**Spring Grip Influence** affects how much grip the tires gain under braking or downforce, this effect can cause under/oversteer.<br>
Other variables hopefully intuitive.

Current vehicle handling presets:
Arcade, Realistic, Offroad, Drift
