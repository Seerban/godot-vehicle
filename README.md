# godot-vehicle

WIP implementation of a 3D Raycast Vehicle, customizable alternative to Godot's VehicleBody3D node.

*Grip Forgiveness* gives the "Arcade" feel (1 = more arcadey, grip not limited by acceleration or braking).

*Spring Grip Influence* affects how much grip the tires gain under braking or downforce, this effect will can under/oversteer.

Other variables hopefully intuitive.


Current vehicle handling presets:

Arcade, Realistic, Offroad, Drift
