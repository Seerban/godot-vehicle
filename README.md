# godot-vehicle

Early WIP implementation of a 3D Raycast Vehicle, customizable alternative to Godot's VehicleBody3D node.

**Depending on the vehicle configuration:**
"Arcade" feel is mostly affected by grip forgiveness parameters (1 = more arcadey).
Realistic is prone to spinning out and understeering as acceleration and braking are either at 0% or 100% for now.

Plan on adding TCS/ABS and improving suspension feel.
